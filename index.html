<p>The Expected Outcomes have formed to descend on Baltimore for the Baseball Analytics Hackathon, hosted by the Baltimore Orioles and Booz Allen Hamilton, on February 5.</p>
<p>As Reds fans and sympathizers, Alex Duke, Aaron Lehr and Zach Sanderson couldn't help but wonder if Bill DeWitt hosted a baseball analytics hackathon in 1965, maybe Milt would have stayed an Oriole and Frank Robinson a Red.</p>

<p>Quick overview bio blurb</p>
<p>Alex, Aaron and Zach are all long-time baseball fans with their main rooting interests being the Braves, Reds and Giants respectively. While living in Chicago, Aaron and Alex have rooted for many visiting teams at Wrigley and US Cellular. Between the three of them, they have seen games in 18 different MLB stadiums and many more in Grapefruit League, Minor League and college stadiums. Aaron and Zach first played baseball together in first grade in Cincinnati and most recently on the beach in Siesta Key between Orioles Spring Training games at Ed Smith Stadium.</p>
<p>Alex grew up in southwest Georgia, so she of course loves the Braves, who didn’t lose a division crown for the first 15 years of her life. After moving closer to Atlanta she attended many Opening Days, donning the jersey of her favorite player, who sadly was traded last year to the evil St. Louis Cardinals. Alex and Aaron also attended last year’s All-Star Game in Cincinnati.</p>
<p>While a baseball fan since birth, Aaron’s enthusiasm increased dramatically during his college years, when baseball’s statistical revolution was in its early stages. A statistics major himself, he’s followed closely ever since, regularly accessing data from sites like Fangraphs and Baseball-Reference, learning about new ways to measure the game from Baseball Prospectus and Beyond the Boxscore, and reading SABR-friendly authors like Rob Neyer, Jonah Keri, and of course, Bill James. His baseball world was truly changed eight years ago when he picked up the book Baseball Between the Numbers, which he promptly shared with Zach.</p>
<p>Zach has been the photographer for the Stanford University baseball team. He now lives on the Iowa tundra so he can only dream about watching baseball in February again. He’s certainly a numbers guy too, but what really gets Zach going on baseball is the quirks, the oddities and the pastoral beauty of the game. That causes his Baseball Twitter follows to lean more toward @flipflopflying and @EephusLeague.</p>
<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
<p>Alex’s experience with data visualization began with a statistics assignment in college. Using Tableau, she was able to make data come to life in new and exciting ways. Since then she has been honing her skills through online learning and user groups. At her first job at Allstate Insurance Company, she combined her Tableau knowledge with the vast data resources of a large company to create innovative tools and resources that help inform vital business decisions. Wanting to take her skills to the next level, she recently accepted a job at Slalom Consulting, where she specializes in data visualization. She works with multiple Fortune 100 companies to improve their use of data in day-to-day business. Alex also volunteers her time to the Tableau Foundation, which helps nonprofit organizations visualize and analyze data. Last October, she attended the Tableau Conference in Las Vegas and has presented at numerous meetings and seminars, including the Tableau Fringe Festival. Alex is experienced with several other data and programming tools that pair well with Tableau, such as SQL, R, SAS, and Alteryx.</p>
<p>For his entire nine-year professional career Aaron has worked at Allstate Insurance Company. He began in the Quantitative Research and Analytics department, working with modeled hurricane and earthquake data. A major part of his job involved querying thousands of modeled years of data housed in a SQL server and creating easy-to-understand visualizations for company leadership. At Allstate, Aaron was also introduced to Tableau and created several dashboards that assisted in troubleshooting and decision-making for the home inspection process.</p>
<p>Zach has worked professionally with hospital data mostly. He has implemented a business intelligence tool and trained financial officers at the hospital on its use to access data provided by his Data Warehouse team. He has also worked at a departmental level collecting and presenting RVU and patient satisfaction data to the department’s physicians. More recently, he has been obsessing over the work of people like Amanda Cox and Mike Bostock. This has led him to start to scratch the surface on some D3.js training and work.</p>
